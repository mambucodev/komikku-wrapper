This is a wrapper for mangas downloaded trough Komikku. It detects komikku's folder and reads its database **without messing with it**. It then shows you a list of all the mangas you downloaded and then procedes to ask you a couple more questions for everything to go smooth.

The output will be either in `.mobi`, `.epub` or `.cbz`.
